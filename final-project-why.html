                    <hr>

                        <p>
                            There is a wide spectrum of human abilities depending on a wide variety of situations.
                        </p>

                            <p>
                                Often have the same functional requirements as other people with disabilities, but their use of digital technology and adoption of assistive technologies may differ.

                            <p>
                                Having combinations of different kinds of disabilities may limit approaches for interacting with digital technology. For example, someone who is deaf and has low vision might benefit from captions for audio, but only if these captions have adjustable size and color.

                                Health conditions may affect stamina, dexterity, or concentration and someone may experience fatigue, pain, or other symptoms that could have an impact on their physical use of digital technology.

                            <p>
                                Some may experience progressive or recurring functional limitations that impact their use of digital technology differently at different times. For example, some may need particular accessibility features on one day and none the next.

                            <p>
                                Some may experience temporary impairments as a result of an accident, surgery, or medication. They may not know about accessibility solutions, may not know how to use accessibility features, and may be unaware of their needs.

                                Some may experience constraints due to their surroundings or other situational aspects. For example, they may be in a loud environment and unable to hear audio, in bright sunlight and unable to see a screen, or they may not be able to afford certain technologies.

                            Those with visual impairments may need the use of a screen reader.

                        <p>
                            Those with mobile or dexterity impairments may need the option of keyboard or mouse only.

                        <p>
                            Those with auditory impairments may need use of closed captioning on videos.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Those with cognitive impairments may need use of a dyslexic friendly font.

                    <h2>Benefits of Universal Design</h2>

                    <hr>

                        <p>
                            Universal Design caters to a larger population's expectations and needs.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For example, a button to push for the doors to open. These buttons were originally installed for wheelchair users, but many others also find it beneficial.
                        </p>

                        <ul>

                            <li>People using crutches</li>
                            <li>People carrying groceries</li>
                            <li>People carrying children</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            For another example, closed captioning. Closed captioning was originally created for those who are deaf or hard of hearing, but many others also find it beneficial.
                        </p>

                        <ul>

                            <li>People with auditory processing disorders</li>
                            <li>People with ADHD</li>
                            <li>People who want to watch something, but are unable to turn on the audio for one reason or another</li>
