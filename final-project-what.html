                        <p>
                            A Universal Design approach considers a diverse range of user abilities in order to create a design that meets the needs of as many people as possible, including those with disabilities. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Universal Design advocates for people to consider this range of user abilities from the start of the design process instead of at the end, like what often happens with accessibility, and to maintain this focus throughout the entire design process.

                                Universal design is a design approach, <em>not</em> a checklist.

                    <hr>

                        <p>
                            Accessible Design and Universal Design are different for many reasons. For example, Universal Design is considered from the start while Accessible Design is usually something separate that follows/meets certain standards or is added after the fact.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Then what is accessibility? Its making sure something is easy to obtain or use for those with disabilities.

                    <h2>Norman's Design Concepts</h2>

                    <hr>

                        <h3>Affordance</h3>

                            <p>
                                Norman did not come up with the term “affordance,” but he is credited with the concept of “perceived affordance.” “Perceived affordance” is how users interpret and perceive the function of a device. If someone has to think about how to operate a device, that usually means the “perceived affordance” of the device is not clear enough.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In order to provide access to a wide variety of users, it is important that users be able to easily understand the function of your device.
                            </p>

                        <h3>Constraints</h3>

                            <p>
                                Constraints limit the actions of users in order to prevent error, misuse, damage to the device, or harm to the user or others.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Norman divides constraints into two categories, physical and psychological; Norman also breaks up the psychological category into three categories: semantic, cultural, and logical.
                            </p>

                            <dl>

                                <dt>Physical</dt>
                                    <dd>Cars are designed with physical properties to prevent users from changing gears in an automatic car without pushing on the brakes.</dd>
    
                                <dt>Psychological: Semantic</dt>
                                    <dd>Semantic constraints warn of improper use through language, symbols, or auditory cues. For example, cars are designed to chime repeatedly if it detects enough weight in the passenger seat, but no bulked seatbelt.</dd>
    
                                <dt>Psychological: Cultural</dt>
                                    <dd>Cultural constraints refer to conventions learned through experience. For example, we know from convention that we pay for purchases at a cashier, typically at the front of the store.</dd>
    
                                <dt>Psychological: Logical</dt>
                                    <dd>Logical constraints refer to times when users may lack semantic or cultural constraints, so users instead deduce the answer through logic. For example, a steering wheel being placed in front of the driver's seat because it makes logical sense for the driver to have access to the steering controls.</dd>
    
                            </dl>

                        <h3>Feedback</h3>

                            <p>
                                Users must receive feedback after every action performed in order to let them know if their action was successful or not. For example, a cursor changing into a spinner while the computer is loading.
                            </p>

                        <h3>Visibility</h3>

                            <p>
                                Visibility refers to the idea that effective design involves making applicable items visible to the user and hiding non-relevant operations. For example, if a user is trying to load a file into a program that only takes PDFs, the computer will gray out all non-PDF files.
                            </p>

                        <h3>Mapping</h3>

                            <p>
                                Mapping is the idea that the controls for a device will closely resemble their effect. For example, a stovetop where the dials are arranged in the same order as the burners to let the user know which dial operates which burner.
                            </p>

                        <p>
                            There are 7 core principles of Universal Design:
                        </p>

                        <ol>

                            <li>Equitable Use
    
                                <ul>

                                    <li class="sublist">Design provides the same means of use for anyone accessing resources: identical whenever possible, equivalent when not.</li>

                                </ul>

                            </li>
    
                            <li>Flexibility in Use
    
                                <ul>

                                    <li class="sublist">Design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities. For example, left or right handed access and use.</li>

                                </ul>

                            </li>
    
                            <li>Simple and Intuitive Use
    
                                <ul>

                                    <li class="sublist">Design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.</li>

                                </ul>

                            </li>

                                <ul>

                                    <li class="sublist">Design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.</li>

                                </ul>

                            </li>
    
                            <li>Tolerance for Error
    
                                <ul>

                                    <li class="sublist">Design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.</li>

                                </ul>

                                <ul>

                                    <li class="sublist">Design can be used efficiently and comfortably. For example, online classes allow consumption of information with little eye strain and fatigue.</li>

                                </ul>

                            </li>

                                <ul>

                                    <li class="sublist">Design provides for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility. For example, online learning platforms allow for the use/integration of assistive devices such as a JAWS reader.</li>

                                        <p>
                                            ARIA was created for screen reader users, and users who cannot use a mouse and must rely on their keyboard.
                                        </p>

                                        <h6>What can ARIA do?</h6>

                                            <summary>Roles</summary>

                                            <p>
                                                Roles are used to define a type of user interface (UI) element. Once a role is set for an element, it does not change.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                States and properties can be applied to elements and are used together to support existing ARIA roles on a page. States can change on their own or with user interaction while properties rarely change once they're set.

                                        <h6>The five rules of ARIA</h6>

                                            <ol>

                                                <li>Use native HTML at all times.</li>
                                                <li>Do not change native HTML semantics unless you absolutely have to.</li>
                                                <li>All interactive ARIA roles must be keyboard accessible.</li>
                                                <li>For all elements that are focusable, do not ever add role=“presentation” or aria-hidden=“true”.</li>
                                                <li>You must give all interactive elements an accessible name.</li>

                                            </ol>

                                <h4>Correct use of HTML Hierarchy</h4>

                                    <p>
                                        HTML utilizes a series of heading options when coding ranging from h1 (heading 1) to h6 (heading 6) and it is important to use them hierarchically so that the content is accurately communicated to assistive technology and any code-reading systems that analyze web pages; for example, search engine web crawlers.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        In order to accomplish this, you may need to including headings that may be redundant for visual users, but you can use CSS to hide those headings in a way that doesn't break the hierarchy, doesn't add more clutter to the page, and makes sure the heading can still be recognized by assistive technology and code-reading systems.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        In addition to headings, HTML lists convey a hierarchical structure.
                                    </p>

                                    <ul>

                                        <li>Unordered lists are for content having no order of sequence or importance.</li>
                                        <li>Ordered lists suggest sequence, order, or ranking. List items are typically prepended with a number, letter, Roman numeral, etc.</li>
                                        <li>Description lists are for key:value pairs, such as terms and definitions in a glossary or questions and answers in a FAQ.</li>

                                    </ul>

                                <h4>Use of Relative Units</h4>

                                    <p>
                                        Instead of using pixels, use em (a unit of measurement that indicates size relative to the size of the font) which will allow your website to correctly adapt to a variety of screen sizes.
                                    </p>

                            <h3>Elements to Consider in Accessible Web Design</h3>

                            <h4>Keyboard Navigation</h4>

                                <p>
                                    For users who can only use keyboard navigation, a website needs to be accessible for those who can't, for one reason or another, use a mouse.
                                </p>

                            <h4>Color Contrast</h4>

                                <p>
                                    For users with low vision or color blindness, checking color contrast throughout the color blindness spectrum.
                                </p>

                            <h4>Fonts</h4>

                                <p>
                                    When choosing a font, make sure it is legible, and size it to be easily readable.
                                </p>

                            <h4>Alt Text</h4>

                                <p>
                                    Add alt text to all images that describes the image, but doesn't give additional information that those not using assistive technology wouldn't get.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    If an image needs more than 100 characters to be accurately described, move the description into its own paragraph where both those using and not using assistive technology can access it.
                                </p>
