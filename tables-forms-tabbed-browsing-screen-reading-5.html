            <h2>About Kartchner Caverns State Park</h2>

            <hr>

            <blockquote cite="https://azstateparks.com/kartchner/explore/what-is-conservation">

                <q>The history of Kartchner Caverns is not a story about a cave alone, but about the <em>interaction</em> between a cave and human beings as well as human beings with each other.</q>

                <cite> - Randy Tufts</cite>

            </blockquote>

            <p>
                In November 1974, Gary Tenen and Randy Tufts were exploring the limestone hills at the eastern base of the Whetstone Mountains. They were looking “for a cave no one had ever found” and found it. The two kept the cave a secret until February 1978 when they told the property owners, James and Lois Kartchner, about their awesome discovery. Since unprotected caves can be seriously damaged by unregulated use, they knew the cave had to be protected. Tenen and Tufts spent several years looking into the possibility of developing the cave themselves. Some members of the Kartchner family lived in Tucson and were very impressed with the development and operation of Catalina State Park by Arizona State Parks. They decided to approach State Parks to see if the agency was interested in acquiring this outstanding resource.

                    <summary>A Cave is Born</summary>

                    <p>
                        It all began with a drop of water. A shallow inland sea covered this area 330 million years ago, depositing layers of sediment that eventually hardened into limestone. Millions of years later, this Escabrosa limestone, along with other rock layers, uplifted to form the Whetstone Mountains. The Escabrosa limestone, due to a type of tremor or fault, down-dropped thousands of feet relative to the mountains above.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Rainwater made slightly acidic by absorbing carbon dioxide from the air and soil, penetrated cracks in the down-dropped limestone block and slowly dissolved passages in it. Later, lowering groundwater levels left behind vast, air-filled rooms.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Kartchner Caverns' wide variety of decorations, called “speleothems,” began forming drop-by-drop over the next 200,000 years.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Water seeping from the surface dissolves minerals on its trip through the limestone. Once it reaches the cave, the trapped carbon dioxide escapes from the water. No longer able to hold the dissolved calcite, the drop deposits its tiny mineral load. Over time, these minerals have created the beautiful speleothems and variety of colors found in the cave. Kartchner Caverns is a “living” cave; the formations are <mark>still</mark> growing!
